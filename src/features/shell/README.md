# Shell

Shared chrome: brand-yellow header, grouped lists, list filter controls, auth frame, and back link.

## How to use

Wrap authenticated **pages** in `AppShell`. Feature screens should not import it — they return page content only. Use `variant="form"` on firmware publish and detail to constrain the column. Render `SignOffCard` on those pages yourself: publish uses authorising copy, detail uses uploaded-by copy. Use `fill` on list pages so chrome stays put and the list fills the leftover laptop height. Pass `fleetNav` on the three fleet screens so `FleetNavTabs` sits in the same slot above the page; that also locks the viewport so upload uses the same main padding as the lists. Pass `header` on `GroupedList` when title, actions, or filters should sit inside the same card as the rows.

`FleetNavTabs` is the Devices / Firmware history / Upload firmware switcher. `resolveFleetTab` picks the selected tab from the path. The Devices tab count lives in `fleetNavCountStore` so the list can update a badge that AppShell renders.

### List toolbars

Filterable lists compose one row from these parts, in this order:

- `SearchField` — pill used in list toolbars (`bg-black/5`, icon then input)
- `SegmentedControl` — the single filter axis that stays visible
- `ActiveFilterChips` — sits under the row and names what is currently narrowing the list

`PopoverSurface` is the floating panel used by the account menu. `useDismiss` gives any popover outside-press and Escape handling.

### Other primitives

- `DefinitionList` — label/value rows on profile and device detail
- `InfoTooltip` — info icon on base-ui's tooltip. Opens on hover and on keyboard focus
- `FormField` / `NativeSelect` / `PrimaryActionButton` — form controls
- `Panel` / `BackLink` / `AuthShell` / `AuthHeading` — layout pieces

## Gotchas

- `fleetNav` also locks the viewport. Upload used to use `py-10` and a `max-w-2xl` wrapper around the tabs, which moved the tab bar relative to the list pages.
- Logo goes to `/internal`.
- The header avatar opens Profile and Log out. Log out goes to `/login/medela`.
- `SegmentedControl` is built on native radio inputs, so arrow keys navigate and the selected state is announced. Each instance scopes its own `name` via `useId`, so two controls on one page never share a group.
- `ActiveFilterChips` skips the segmented axis, since that control already shows its own state.
- `InfoTooltip` renders a solid popup, not the frosted `PopoverSurface` — dense text over a blurred page is hard to read. Its content portals outside the trigger, so do not nest it inside a `useDismiss` popover: pressing it reads as an outside press.
- Unused list menus, dialogs, and shadcn table/select/badge primitives were removed on purpose. Rebuild them when a screen needs them; they are not a missing backlog.
